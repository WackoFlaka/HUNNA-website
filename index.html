        <h1>Dear Chillzone,</h1>
        <p>
            By the time you find this it probably means I made the final decision and I will explain that in a bit. Ive
            been in Chillzone for probably about two years and honestly I've never been so happy making all of these
            friends on the way and making amazing memories. Even when I first joined I thought I was going to have hard
            time making friends but I didn't, I was glad that I met so many people and enjoyed talking to each and every
            one of them.
        </p>
        <p>
            I just want to let you know, that it isn't you but its me. I've been suffering from severe depression for
            awhile and life really hasn't been looking to well for my future. I honestly been so focused on others than
            myself and I've just keep reminding myself that I need to look out for me first at all costs.
        </p>
        <p>
            My final decision is to leave Chillzone and finally start working on myself and building a better future. I
            don't want any distractions and I want to figure this out on my own. It really does hurt me a lot but I've
            noticed every day my life its been taking me away as a person and not able to be myself. I really hope you
            understand and respect my decision. Chillzone will always have a special place in my heart and will never
            forget the memories and friends I made.
        </p>
        <p>
            Till next time, amigos :)
